# Tip Calculator App ðŸ§®ðŸ’¸

Welcome to the Tip and Consumption Calculator project! This app allows users to browse a menu, add items to an order, and calculate the total cost including a gratuity tip. It's built with **React** and styled using **Tailwind CSS** for a clean and responsive design.

## Features

**ðŸ’¡ Menu Interaction**

- Users can browse a menu of items, each displaying its name and price.
- By clicking on a menu item, it is added to the order, dynamically updating the cart with the selected items and their quantities.

**ðŸ›’ Order Management**

- The order is displayed on the right side of the interface, showing each item, its price, and quantity.
- Users can remove items from the order by clicking the "X" button next to each item.
- If no items are in the order, a message displays: "Empty order."

**ðŸ’° Tip Calculation**

- Once an order exists, users can select a tip percentage (10%, 15%, or 20%) to be applied to the subtotal.
  T- he tip amount is automatically calculated and displayed alongside the subtotal and total.

**ðŸ“‘ Order Summary**

- The **Order Totals** section displays a detailed summary:

  - **Subtotal:** The total cost of the items in the order.
  - **Tip:** The calculated tip based on the selected percentage.
  - **Total:** The sum of the subtotal and tip.

- Users can finalize their order by clicking the Save order button, which resets the state of the order and tip, preparing the app for a new session.

## Key Technologies and Tools
